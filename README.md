# Beach Bacteria Prediction Modeling Project

## Problem

Texas beaches are a great place to relax and have fun, but there are potential dangers in the water. Bacteria levels can exceed safe levels causing the state to close beaches (loss of revenue for locals) or at worst make bathers sick. 

The state currently tests and reports bacteria levels for several beaches and displays bacteria counts at [TexasBeachWatch.com](https://cgis.glo.texas.gov/Beachwatch/#).

The problem is that testing occurs weekly or bi weekly, there is a delay time of at least three if not more days from when the sample is taken and finally reported to the public. By the time results come back, bacteria levels may have risen to unsafe levels.

## Proposal

Using historical bacteria sample and weather records, we propose to train a regression model that estimates the bacteria counts when provided weather information. If successful, the delay from testing to reporting to the public would be greatly reduced.
