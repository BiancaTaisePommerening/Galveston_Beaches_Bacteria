# Website

## Design Solution

- Use HTML and CSS to build the structure and add style;
- Create a drop down menu with the name of the beaches;
    - The user select one of the beaches from the menu which triggers the connection with the machine learning model and displays an output, with the result being "Risky" or "Non_Risky".
- Tableau Public is connected to the website to display the graphs that tell the story of the data;
- The website is going to be hosted on github-pages.
